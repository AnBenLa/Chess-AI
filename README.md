# Chess-AI
Simple Chess program written in Python
========================

**Requirements**:  
- [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Python](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)  
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)


**Features**:
- Most chess rules are implemented
- all possible new chess boards given the current board and user are being generated
- Users can play locally against each other
- a simple recursive enemy is implemented at the moment (it only maximized short time profit)
- a random enemy can be chosen to allow for a bit of fun when playing

**Open Features**:
- "Rochade" and "Schlagen en passant" is not implemented yet. 
- MonteCarlo-Tree Search is not implemented yet
- Maybe a network feature might be nice as well
- UI might be also make sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
